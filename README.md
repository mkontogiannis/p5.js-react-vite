# A p5.js React/Vite boilerplate w/ Typescript

This is a simple boilerplate for writing p5.js sketches in React with typescript.

It uses the awesome [@p5-wrapper/react](https://github.com/P5-wrapper/react) library for rendering the `Sketch` as a `React` component and [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) for super easy `SEO` configuration.

DEMO on Vercel (https://p5-js-react-vite.vercel.app/)

## Usage

Clone the repository without the whole history:<br />
`git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:mkontogiannis/p5.js-react-vite.git`

The application has been created using [create vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite) and uses its standard development / deployment process.

For `SEO` you will have to update the `seo.json` file accordingly
